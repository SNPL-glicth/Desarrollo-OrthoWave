# Objective: Synchronize Doctor and Patient Calendars

## Overview

The goal is to synchronize the calendars of doctors and patients such that when a doctor has availability (e.g., "Dr. Juan" has open slots on Monday), the same availability is visible to their patients (e.g., "Miguel") in a patient-specific calendar interface. This will allow patients to request appointments based on real-time availability.

## Appointment Cycle

The cycle for handling appointments will consist of three main stages:

1. **Request**: The patient requests an appointment based on the doctor's available slots.
2. **Approval**: The doctor reviews the appointment request and approves it.
3. **Confirmation**: Once approved, the appointment is confirmed, and both doctor and patient receive notifications.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Calendar Integration**
   - Implement a shared calendar interface for doctors and patients.
   - Ensure that doctors' availabilities are automatically synced with the patient view.

2. **Appointment Management**
   - Develop functionality allowing patients to request appointments based on displayed availability.
   - Create mechanisms for doctors to approve or deny appointment requests.

3. **Notification System**
   - Implement notifications to inform both parties about the status of requested and confirmed appointments.

4. **User Interface Considerations**
   - Design intuitive interfaces for both roles to manage and view calendar events and appointments effectively.

5. **Backend Integration**
   - Ensure the backend supports calendar synchronization and appointment lifecycle management.
   - Secure backend APIs to handle appointment requests and confirmations.

## Notes

- The synchronization mechanism should account for real-time updates and avoid conflicts.
- Consider potential privacy concerns and ensure that only relevant information is shared between doctor and patient accounts.
